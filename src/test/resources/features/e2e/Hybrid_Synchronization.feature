  Scenario Outline: Verify dynamic note created via UI is retrievable via GET API
    Given the user is logged into the Notes UI with valid credentials
    When the user creates a note via UI with title "<title>" description "<description>" and category "<category>"
    Then the GET "/notes" API should return the note with title "<title>"

    Examples:
      | title                        | description                      | category |
      | Sync Note Home - 5001        | Home note for sync test          | Home     |
      | Sync Note Work - 5002        | Work note for sync test          | Work     |
      | Sync Note Personal - 5003    | Personal note for sync test      | Personal |

  Scenario Outline: Verify editing a note via UI is reflected in the API
    Given the user is logged into the Notes UI with valid credentials
    And a note exists via UI with title "<original_title>" description "<original_desc>" category "<category>"
    When the user edits that note with new title "<updated_title>" and description "<updated_desc>"
    Then the GET "/notes" API should return the note with title "<updated_title>"

    Examples:
      | original_title        | original_desc          | category | updated_title              | updated_desc           |
      | Edit Sync Note - 6001 | Original sync note     | Home     | Edit Sync Note UPDATED-6001| Updated sync content   |
      | Edit Sync Note - 6002 | Second sync note       | Work     | Edit Sync Note UPDATED-6002| Second updated content |

  Scenario Outline: Verify note created via API appears on the UI dashboard
    Given the user is logged into the Notes UI with valid credentials
    When a note is created via the API with title "<title>" description "<description>" and category "<category>"
    And the user refreshes the UI dashboard
    Then the API created note with title "<title>" should be visible on the UI dashboard

    Examples:
      | title                    | description                    | category |
      | API Created Note - 7001  | Created via API for UI check   | Personal |
